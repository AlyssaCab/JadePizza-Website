        <h2>Manage Menu Help</h2>
        <p>
            The Manage Menu page allows admins to add, view, and delete items on the main menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            To add a new item, fill out the form at the bottom of the page. Youâ€™ll need to provide a name, description, category (Pizza, Drink, or Side), an image path, and select size options.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each size selected will require a corresponding price. Only valid sizes can be used for each category (e.g., Pizzas use Small, Medium, Large; Drinks use Can).
        </p>
        <p>
            You can also check the box at the very bottom, labeled "Mark as Special," if you would like the item to be highligted as a special item on the home page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once submitted, the item will appear on the menu immediately. You can remove any existing item by clicking the delete button next to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: Please make sure that you have the image file path in the images folder of the code, and follow the images/example.png format. (.png can be replaced by whatever file type you add)
