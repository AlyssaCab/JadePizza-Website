        <h2>Ordering Help</h2>
        <p>
            To place an order, first navigate to the login or register section in the navigation bar, as all users must be logged in before ordering.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once logged in, go to the menu tab in the navigation bar. Here, you'll see everything currently offered, including pizzas, sides, drinks, and any available deals.
        </p>
        <p>
            To select an item to purchase, click on the item (for example, Pepperoni Pizza) and choose the size you'd like from the dropdown, and then click the "Add to Cart" button.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you'd like to use a deal, click on the deal and then click the "Apply Deal" button. The cart will show the deal and indicate whether its requirements have been met.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you're ready to complete your order, go to the checkout page, fill out your payment and delivery details, and click "Place Order."
